# IExec_private-code-tutorial
This is an example of the workspace used to follow the tutorial "The Full Power of iExec" (available soon).

The objective is to introduce most of the features available with iExec through a "private code monetization" use case: 
Being able to let people use your new state of the art sorting algorithm (or bubble sort in the example) against remuneration without ever disclosing the code of this algorithm.

# IExec private code valorisation tutorial / "The Full Power of iExec"
In this repository, you can find an example of the workspace used to follow the tutorial "The Full Power of iExec" available in the [wiki](https://github.com/iExecBlockchainComputing/private-code-valorisation_tutorial/wiki) section.

The objective is to introduce most of the features available with iExec through a "private code monetization" use case: 
Being able to let people use your new state of the art sorting algorithm (or bubble sort in the example) against remuneration without ever disclosing the code of this algorithm.
